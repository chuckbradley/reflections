When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When using multiple devices and/or when multiple users need access.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To make sure that updates are known and intentional. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A repository initally conisists of a single branch. Additional branches can be created for alternate, potentially parallel, versions of the repository.
A clone is a copy of the repository (with git functionality: history, branches, etc.). Example: a remote repository can be cloned from GitHub to a local machine.
A fork is a GitHub-specific duplicate of a repository that includes a reference to the source. GitHub also includes a reference from the sorce repository to all forks. A fork should be created when the duplicated content is independent from the source after the forking.
