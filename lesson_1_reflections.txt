Should I go back and add questions?

Viewing a diff can allow me to see which line(s) were changed and what the 
changes were. 

Using that, I can confirm that all changes were as desired.

By saving versions, I can be more confident with making changes.

I will know that I can "undo" the changes if necessary.

Commits should take place for each logical change.

Multiple areas or features shouldn't be committed together.

Each little change might be too frequent.

Some version control systems allow saving multiple files in one commit because 
the files are more likely to be interconnected.

git log displays the history of commits

git diff shows the details of the changes made within each file in a particular 
commit.

Since git checkout would allow me to return to a working state, I might be 
willing to introduce code that might break something: lower risk

I still need more information before I begin using git seriously.
